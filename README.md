👋 Hey there! I'm Yashwardhan Jain, a passionate data analysis enthusiast with a knack for problem-solving and deriving data-driven insights. 

🎓 Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics with a minor in Statistics at the University of Saskatchewan, I'm diving deep into the world of quantitative analysis and mathematical modeling.

💻 My journey involves exploring diverse projects on GitHub, from multiple regression analysis and retail price optimization to investigating consumer behavior patterns using R-based analytics. Always eager to learn and apply new techniques in data analysis.

🔍 Recently, I worked on a captivating Bellabeat Case Study as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. Leveraging R, I delved into Fitbit fitness data, unraveling intriguing correlations between user activities, sleep patterns, and recommending app features for promoting healthier habits.
